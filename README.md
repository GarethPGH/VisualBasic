# VisualBasic
 Visual Basic Projects from School. Includes database access, inheritence, multiple frames and writing files. Interesting stuff in Chapters 6-13. Don't be too impressed with the layout. I copied the examples from the problem questions to save time, and then "fancied it up" after getting them working.
